/*
  *This function sets indices and gain so that the multi-tap delay at the
 * heart of this class has an impulse response with the following 
 * characteristics:
 *
 * 1. There is an output tap at index 0, representing the dry signal
 * 2. There are numberTaps additional delayed output taps, with timings
 *    randomised between 0 and the maximum delay time, using the velvet
 *    noise algorithm for randomisation.
 * 3. The gains of the output taps are of the form {a, -b, -b,..., -b, b}
 *    where a is the dry gain, and a and b have the same sign.
 * 4. the values a and b are calculated to ensure that gain at the DC
 *    frequency (zero frequency) is unitary and the average gain over the
 *    entire frequency range is also unitary, although the gain at each
 *    specific nonzero frequency is random.
 * 5. the deviation from unity near zero is small, so that the
 *    randomisation of the spectrum occurs mainly above a specified 
 *    threshold frequency.

     * The formulae for dry and output tap gains emerge when we 
     * solve for x=dryGain and y=delayTapGain under the following 
     * two constraints:
     *
     * 1. filter gain at DC is unity
     * 2. total broad spectrum gain is unity
     *
     * dryGain = (-4 m^2 + n + 4 m n - n^2)/(4 m^2 + n - 4 m n + n^2)
     * delayTapGain = (2 (2 m - n))/(4 m^2 + n - 4 m n + n^2)
     *
     *
     * For the record, the system of equations we solved to find those 
     * formulae is as follows:
     *
     *  Solve[{x + y m - y (n - m) == 1, Sqrt[x^2 + n y^2] == 1}, {x, y}]
     *
     * ...where x is the dryGain, y is the delayTap gain, n is the total
     * number of delay taps, excluding the dry signal tap, and m is the
     * total number of delay taps for which the sign of delayTapGain
     * is NOT inverted.
     *
     * The purpose of setting signs this way is to have the first tap
     * (dry signal) and last delay tap be the same sign, but all the 
     * taps in between have opposite sign. The result of this is an 
     * impulse response that correlates in a predictable way with the
     * first cosine term of the Fourier series.
     *
     * (recall that in the first cosine term of the Fourier series, 
     * the ends (f=0 and f=2*PI) have opposite sign from
     * the middle region (near f=PI)). 
     *
     * Having predictable correlation with the first term of the Fourier
     * series means that we expect less variation from the filter in
     * the frequency bin just above 0. This particular system, we know
     * from trial and error, gives the first term of the Fourier series 
     * very near unity. That helps us to use this filter to add variation
     * to the upper part of the spectrum while leaving the lower part
     * unaffected. To control the frequency range where it is near unity
     * gain change, we simply shorten or lengthen the filter kernel.
