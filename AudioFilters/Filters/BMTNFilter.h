    /*
      *This function is optional.  If you don't call it, the filter will
     * use reasonable default settings.
     *
     *
     * filterOrder - set the order of the FIR Least Mean Squares Filter used
     *               to do the separation.  Default = 48. Higher values work
     *               better but take more processing power so use the lowest
     *               value that still gives a clear separation.
     *               For best performance this should be a multiple of 4.
     *
     *
     * mu - rate of convergence, mu in (0,1]. Higher values acheive separation
     *      more quickly after the initial attack of each note, but with
     *      faster convergence rate, some noise remains in the tonal signal
     *      output. Lower values adapt more slowly to attacks and changes in
     *      tonal content, but remove more noise from the tonal signal. If the
     *      value is too low, there will be some tone left back in the noise
     *      signal output.
     *
     *
     * delayTime - delays the input signal by n=delayTime samples before
     *             estimating the tonal content. If n == 1, only white noise
     *             can be removed. For other types of noise, there is some
     *             correlation between adjacent samples. For example, in
     *             brown noise, low frequency components dominate so the kth
     *             sample is close in value to the k+1th sample. In this
     *             situation, a linear predictor will be able to predict the
     *             next sample in the noise signal with some accuracy. This
     *             will result in low frequency noise being classified as
     *             tone, since the LMS filter considers anything it can
     *             predict with a linear model to be tonal.  To avoid this,
     *             we delay the linear predictor input behind the main signal
     *             input by n samples, where n is sufficiently large to ensure
     *             that the kth sample of the noise is not correlated with the
     *             k+nth sample. Setting n too low results in a noise signal
     *             that lacks bass frequency noise and a tonal signal that
     *             contains some low-frequency noise. Setting delayTime = n
     *             means that the first n samples of every transient will not
     *             be separated at all and will go 100% to the noise output,
     *             leaving nothing in the tonal output.  Since most musical
     *             sounds begin with a noisy attack sound, this is usually
     *             acceptable for small values of n.
