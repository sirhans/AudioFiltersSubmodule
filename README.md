# Blue Mangoo signal processing components toolbox submodule

The code in this repository should be included into an XCode project either by downloading and copying the files or by linking to the repo as a git submodule.

We make this code available freely online to all who can find a use for it. Most of the classes in this repository are implementations of standard signal processing algorithms. Since we use the components from this toolbox in our products, many of them are extensively optimised and tested to ensure high efficiency and excellent sound quality. However, this repo also includes experimental code that has not been tested and in some cases does not work at all. Unfortunately, the documentation in the .c and .h files generally does not indicate which code is reliable and which is not. Of course, a look at the commit history can be a helpful indication of how much attention each component has received from the developers.
